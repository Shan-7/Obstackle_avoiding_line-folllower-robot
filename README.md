Introduction
In this fascinating project, we’ll investigate the use of an Arduino and an L298 Motor Driver to create a Line Follower Robot that can avoid obstacles. Robots that follow lines are extensively employed in several sectors for activities like moving objects and engaging in entertaining events like robotic racing. This project creates a flexible and dynamic robot by fusing the intelligence to avoid obstacles with the precision of line following. With the Arduino IDE and a variety of components, you can build an intelligent robot that can navigate through challenging settings.

Circuit Diagram
According to the circuit schematic for the project “Line Follower with Obstacle Avoiding Robot,” a thorough setup is needed for the robot to operate. The main power source is made up of two 3.7-volt batteries connected in series to provide 7.4 volts overall. A power switch is included in for easy on/off control. An Arduino UNO, two infrared (IR) sensors for line-following on the left and right sides, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for identifying obstacles, and a tiny servo motor are the main parts. While following a black line is the robot’s main task, it can also navigate obstacles by using an ultrasonic sensor to detect their closeness on either side. The two DC gear motors that enable both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation depend on the L298 Motor Driver. The left and right side motors are controlled by different pins on the L298 that are connected to the Arduino in a certain way, allowing for speed control. The L298 is connected to a 12V positive and ground connector to deliver power to the motors. This circuit schematic provides the framework for constructing the project’s hardware.
